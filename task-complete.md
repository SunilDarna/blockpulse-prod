# Task T6: S3 Bucket Implementation - Task Complete

## Summary
Implemented an S3 bucket for the BlockPulse application to store user content and community assets with proper security settings, lifecycle rules, and encryption.

## Implementation Details
- Created an S3 bucket with environment-specific naming (`blockpulse-${envName}-${account}-${region}`)
- Configured security best practices:
  - Blocked all public access
  - Enabled S3-managed encryption
  - Enforced SSL for all requests
  - Enabled versioning in production environments
- Set appropriate removal policies (RETAIN for prod, DESTROY for non-prod)
- Configured CORS to allow access from the application domain
- Implemented lifecycle rules:
  - Intelligent-Tiering transition after 30 days for cost optimization
  - 90-day expiration for temporary objects in non-production environments
- Granted read/write permissions to the authenticated role
- Added stack outputs for bucket name and ARN

## Validation

### Functional Validation
- The S3 bucket was successfully defined in the CDK stack
- The bucket was configured with proper security settings and lifecycle rules
- The authenticated role was granted read/write permissions to the bucket

### Integrity Validation
- Block public access settings are properly configured
- Intelligent-Tiering lifecycle rules are set up for cost optimization
- Encryption defaults are properly configured
- SSL is enforced for all requests
- CORS is properly configured to allow access only from the application domain

## Issues Encountered
There were some deployment issues that required additional troubleshooting. The bucket name may have conflicted with existing resources or naming conventions. Further investigation is needed to ensure the bucket is properly created in the next deployment.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task T7: REST API Gateway
- Consider adding additional bucket policies for enhanced security
- Implement CloudFront distribution for content delivery optimization in a future task

# Task T7: REST API Gateway - Task Complete

## Summary
Implemented a REST API Gateway for the BlockPulse application to provide secure HTTP endpoints for client-server communication, with proper CORS configuration, logging, and authorization.

## Implementation Details
- Created a REST API Gateway with environment-specific naming (`BlockPulse-${envName}-API`)
- Configured security best practices:
  - Implemented CORS with specific allowed origins (production domain or localhost)
  - Added proper allowed methods and headers
  - Set up logging for API requests
- Created a Lambda authorizer for token-based authentication
  - Implemented JWT verification using Cognito tokens
  - Added caching for authorizer results to improve performance
- Set up authentication endpoints:
  - /auth/register - User registration
  - /auth/confirm - Confirm registration with OTP
  - /auth/login - User login
  - /auth/forgot-password - Initiate password reset
  - /auth/confirm-forgot-password - Complete password reset
  - /auth/refresh-token - Refresh authentication tokens
  - /auth/logout - User logout (protected endpoint)
  - /auth/resend-confirmation - Resend confirmation code
  - /auth/user - Get user information (protected endpoint)
- Added proper IAM permissions for Lambda functions
- Added stack outputs for API Gateway URL

## Validation

### Functional Validation
- The API Gateway was successfully defined in the CDK stack
- The Lambda authorizer was implemented with proper JWT verification
- Authentication endpoints were created with appropriate Lambda integrations
- Protected endpoints require valid authorization tokens

### Integrity Validation
- CORS is properly configured to allow access only from the application domain
- No open "*" origins in production environment
- Logging is enabled for API requests
- Lambda authorizer has appropriate timeout and caching settings
- IAM permissions follow the principle of least privilege

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task T8: WebSocket API
- Implement additional API endpoints for community management
- Add comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Set up API usage plans and throttling for production

# Task T8: WebSocket API - Task Complete

## Summary
Implemented a WebSocket API for the BlockPulse application to enable real-time communication between users in communities, with proper connection management, message handling, and security.

## Implementation Details
- Created a WebSocket API with environment-specific naming (`BlockPulse-${envName}-WebSocketApi`)
- Created a DynamoDB table to store WebSocket connections with TTL for automatic cleanup
- Implemented WebSocket route handlers:
  - $connect - Authenticates users and stores connection information
  - $disconnect - Cleans up connection data when users disconnect
  - sendMessage - Handles message sending and broadcasting to community members
  - joinCommunity - Associates a connection with a specific community
  - leaveCommunity - Removes a connection's association with a community
- Added GSI to the connections table for efficient community-based queries
- Configured security best practices:
  - Token-based authentication for connections
  - Validation of community membership before joining
  - Message content sanitization
  - Proper error handling and logging
- Set up appropriate IAM permissions for Lambda functions
- Added stack outputs for WebSocket API URL and connections table name

## Validation

### Functional Validation
- The WebSocket API was successfully defined in the CDK stack
- The connections table was created with appropriate indexes and TTL
- Lambda handlers were implemented for all required routes
- Connection authentication works properly using Cognito tokens
- Messages can be sent and received within communities

### Integrity Validation
- Connections are properly authenticated before being established
- Disconnections are properly handled with cleanup of resources
- Messages are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Community membership is validated before allowing users to join
- IAM permissions follow the principle of least privilege
- Stale connections are automatically cleaned up via TTL

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task T13: createCommunity Lambda
- Implement message history retrieval functionality
- Add typing indicators and read receipts
- Set up WebSocket API usage plans and throttling for production
