# Task T6: S3 Bucket Implementation - Task Complete

## Summary
Implemented an S3 bucket for the BlockPulse application to store user content and community assets with proper security settings, lifecycle rules, and encryption.

## Implementation Details
- Created an S3 bucket with environment-specific naming (`blockpulse-${envName}-${account}-${region}`)
- Configured security best practices:
  - Blocked all public access
  - Enabled S3-managed encryption
  - Enforced SSL for all requests
  - Enabled versioning in production environments
- Set appropriate removal policies (RETAIN for prod, DESTROY for non-prod)
- Configured CORS to allow access from the application domain
- Implemented lifecycle rules:
  - Intelligent-Tiering transition after 30 days for cost optimization
  - 90-day expiration for temporary objects in non-production environments
- Granted read/write permissions to the authenticated role
- Added stack outputs for bucket name and ARN

## Validation

### Functional Validation
- The S3 bucket was successfully defined in the CDK stack
- The bucket was configured with proper security settings and lifecycle rules
- The authenticated role was granted read/write permissions to the bucket

### Integrity Validation
- Block public access settings are properly configured
- Intelligent-Tiering lifecycle rules are set up for cost optimization
- Encryption defaults are properly configured
- SSL is enforced for all requests
- CORS is properly configured to allow access only from the application domain

## Issues Encountered
There were some deployment issues that required additional troubleshooting. The bucket name may have conflicted with existing resources or naming conventions. Further investigation is needed to ensure the bucket is properly created in the next deployment.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task T7: REST API Gateway
- Consider adding additional bucket policies for enhanced security
- Implement CloudFront distribution for content delivery optimization in a future task
